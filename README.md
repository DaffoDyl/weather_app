# weather_app

A simple weather app made with Flutter. Displays the temperature and weather conditions at current location.

An animation sourced from https://lottiefiles.com/ plays in the center of the screen depending on the weather conditions.

This app reads from an API from https://openweathermap.org/

Currently only pulls location data when on Android or IOS.
